**Generation of Izvedeno and Situacija Documents**  
1. Unzip the archive into any convenient folder on your PC (won’t work on macOS for now – too many external dependencies would need to be installed).  
2. Place the exported certificate file into the **Input** folder (an example file is also provided).  
3. Run the **start.exe** file.  
4. Separate Excel files will be generated in the **Output** folder and its subfolders.  
5. In the generated *situacija* file, manually enter the Euro exchange rate (as there's no way to fetch it automatically), then save the file.  
6. Done.  

To generate a new document package, the client just needs to create a new certificate on the platform, export it, place it into the **Input** folder, and run the EXE file again – previous files will remain, and new ones will be added to the same folders.
